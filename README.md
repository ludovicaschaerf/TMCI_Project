# Thematic Analysis of Album Lyrics

## Abstract
A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

The aim of the project is to evaluate to what extent are a musical artist’s work reflective of their cultural world. More specifically, we intend to conduct topic analyses on the lyrics of well-established artists with considerably large discographies. These artists include Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Black Sabbath, Joy Division, and Metallica. The artists that were picked published music in similar timeframes, so that it is easier to draw a correlation between the results of each discography. Each artist was also selectively chosen because of their distinct background genre blends. Even when Black Sabbath and Metallica are both metal bands, they still differ in their respective subgenres. The relevance and motivation of this project lies comfortably in the disciple of cultural studies; i.e. to see if there is any within-period, cross-genre similarity between artist’s lyrics. If any similarity is found, we will try to link this similarity to historical events belonging to the common knowledge sphere of their respective time periods, to see if there is any relationship between an artist’s lyrics and their socio-cultural environment at the time of release. 

## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
*1* Is there any within-period, cross-genre similarity between artists’ lyrics?
*2* To what extent do lyrics from different time periods share similar content?
*3* To what extent do lyrics from varying musical genres share similar content?
*4* Is there a relationship between an artist’s lyrics and their socio-cultural environment at the time of release?
