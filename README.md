# Thematic Analysis of Album Lyrics

## Abstract
A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

*Idea 01*
Idea: extrapolate the themes of each of the top 10 famous albums in the 70’s and 80’s of Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Black Sabbath and Joy Division using their song lyrics. Once that is done, we can consider the top 10 themes per album in time and reflect on whether they:
Are expressive of a personal event in the lives/careers of the bands
Are expressive of a socio-political event of the years (if in common between 2 or more bands)
Are expressive of the music taste of the time
Are expressive of the musical conventions of the genre

*Idea 02*
Extrapolate the themes from albums of artists from the lyrics and determine how the albums are representative of a specific point in the artist’s career/life.

If we go with this, we have to ignore time period (eg. Blackstar), but we one artist suffices.


## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
*1* Do the themes of musical albums reflect more their personal or the socio-political events?


## Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show you've read the docs and are familiar with some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
